# Data Mining Project: Noise Robust Federate Learning

This is the repository for all four approaches that will eventually comprise the project

## How to run our code:

### Option 1: From Source

Method 1: Conda:(Recommended)
```bash
conda create --name DM_project_Noise_robust_FL python=3.11
```

Method 1: venv:(Recommended)
create a virtual environment using venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv DM_project_Noise_robust_FL
```
then to activate:
```bash
source DM_project_Noise_robust_FL/bin/activate
```
and to deactivate:
```bash
deactivate
```
download all the packages in requirements.txt using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

for each approach go to the respective folder and check the README there

### Method 2: From release:
Simply download the ZIP file in the release section and open the folder in terminal and run:
```bash
source portable_env/bin/activate
```
This will run the virtual environment with all the dependencies installed. ENSURE that python version is 3.11.
